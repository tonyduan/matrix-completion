    Matrix completion library for Python


This client is a wrapper around Yahoo's API found here:
https://developer.yahoo.com/boss/search/boss_api_guide/

Usage:

    (use 'yboss.api)
    (query-yboss "your query here" :limitedweb oauth-key oauth-secret)

    This call will return a list of query results, formatted as hashmaps.

    At the moment, the following query types are supported:
    #{:limitedweb :web :images :news :spelling}


Why:

    There are plenty of Clojure APIs written around supporting Twitter,
    Facebook, Alexa and the like but none for the Yahoo BOSS API. This is in
    large due to the fact that very few libraries support the 'GET' call for
    OAuthV1, which is what the Yahoo BOSS API requires.

    This libary was built in response to thse issues. It is built upon the Java
    Scribe OAuth library, at https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java.
